# Computer Vision RPS

## Milestone 2
This milestone centres around the creation of the ML model that the program will use to recognise the user input. The framework for the model was provided by https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/. The model has 4 classes of images that it can recognise: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. The model was trained with approximately 8,000 images. For the purpose of this project, the model is accurate enough to move on to the later steps. However, the model can still be optimised with a larger set of more diverse training data.
